# DSA-project
DSA project - online shopping interface
**Synopsis:**

This Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project utilizes binary search trees to organize products in five categories. The main functions include insertion, traversal, and cart management. A linked list structure handles the shopping cart. The project demonstrates the application of tree structures for efficient categorization and traversal. To compile and execute the project, use the GCC command:

bash
gcc proj.c -o shopping_app
./shopping_app

This shopping application showcases the versatility of data structures in organizing and managing diverse product categories efficiently.
